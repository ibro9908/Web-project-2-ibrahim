              Although the treaty had occured to to be essentially about peace
              and friendship, after the 8 days of treaty making, it ended with
              Indigenous groups agreeing to cede, release, surrender, and yield
              up their lands to the Crown in exchange for annual annuities,
              material goods, and agricultural supplies.

                Outside Promises?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Outside promises refer to oral promisses made during the
                creation of treaty one but not actually written down. Indigenous
                people thought would be included in what they were getting but
                at first the Canadian government didnt recognize these promises
                as something they had to do but this was later done in 1875 4
                years after the creation of treaty 1. Some outside promisses
                included Additional Farming Equipment, a suit of clothing every
                three years for each chief and flags and medals also for chiefs.

              <p>
                Land set aside for First Nations communities (called reserves).
                A small amount of money every year for each person. Farming
                tools, animals, and seeds to help them start farming. The right
                to hunt and fish on land not being used by settlers.

              <p>
                First Nations can have their own governments that make decisions
                for their people. They get full ownership of some land and help
                manage natural resources like forests or water. Agreements to
                protect the environment. Ways to make money from resources like
                mining, oil, or hydro projects (like getting a share of the
                profits).

              <p>
                Today, Treaty 1 is being put into action by helping First
                Nations grow their communities and businesses, get back land,
                and make their own decisions. This includes creating urban
                reserves, starting new businesses, and working with the
                government. Like, Kapyong Barracks / Naawi-Oodena reserve.
                Formerly a military base in Winnipeg, this land was returned
                after a long legal battle. Plans include: Housing Retail and
                office space Cultural and recreational centres Education and
                training facilities. These actions show that Treaty 1 is still
                important today. It wasnâ€™t just an agreement from the past it
                was meant to create an ongoing relationship.
